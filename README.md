This is an sample application written to demonstrate what I consider to be the *correct* way of setting up RequireJs.

A writeup of this technique is [available on my Github blog](https://github.com/togakangaroo/Blog/blob/master/setting-up-requirejs.md).

Run this application with any webserver. Or, if you are on windows, simply [execute the included webserver mongoose_aug12.exe](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/) and point your browser to http://localhost:8080
